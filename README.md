# OpenIn App By Listed Inc.

This project adheres to modern Android development practices and adopts a single activity architecture to enhance scalability and ease of maintenance.

The project implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which offers several features and advantages:Separation of Concerns,Testability,Data Binding,Reactive Programming,Maintainability and Scalability,Code Reusability

The OpenInApp project incorporates various key components such as Navigation, Single Activity Architecture, MVVM, LiveData, Coroutines, and SharedPreferences. These components work together to enhance the project's functionality and structure.

For testing phase, I utilized the MockWebServer and OkHttp Idling Resource to set up a mocked API response. This setup will allow us to verify the behavior of the application in the event of changes to the attributes in the API response. By simulating different scenarios, We could ensure that the app responded correctly and handles any variations in the API data.

To visualize the data in a graph, the project utilizes the MpChart library. The data is displayed in the graph, assuming a time frame of one month, as per the provided API specifications.
